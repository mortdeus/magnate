This is a demo I created in a 10 day personal speed challenge for the playstation mobile closed beta sdk. The project consisted of over 10,000 lines of code and was done while learning the SDK. I lead the project as lead programmer, and project manager. I also wrote the games script as we went along. This demo was shown at sony's Playstation Mobile boot at GDC2012. For completing this feat and to show their appreciation, Sony sent me a 100 dollar psn card!
